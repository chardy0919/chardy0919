### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first personal project to graduate from Code Platoon!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of the fundamental languages and frameworks such as: Django, React, BootStrap, PostgreSQL, Flask, Tailwind, HTML, Pytohn, CSS, Javascript, and more!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any fun projects just to build a network of friends!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I found Software Development, video games, music, or fun nerdy things like DnD and MTG.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My wife and I have a loving family of 2 cats and a big dog named Molly. They love to sniff around all my music gear and start mischief.
